\section* { Numbrix solution }

Our basic strategy to solving the Numbrix puzzle was to:

\begin { enumerate }
\item Read the puzzle from raw text to a 2D array of structs representing cells on the grid
\item Create a sorted array of those cell that have values greater than 0
\item Iterate up and down the list, trying to fill in gaps between numbers with a DFS on the grid.
\end { enumerate }
